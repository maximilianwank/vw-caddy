# vw-caddy
Deploy vaultwarden with a caddy reverse proxy.

The current scope is an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023. 
Some parts like setting up the server and the generation of config files are 
already separated to be prepared for other deployment scenarios.

## :gear: Setup
1. Run the Cloudformation template `cloudformation.yaml` to create the EC2 instance.
2. SSH into the instance.

4. Add the result to `~/vw_caddy/docker-compose.yml` in the `environment` section.
